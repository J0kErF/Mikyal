## Introduction:

This project aims to combat the harmful effects of bias in news media, particularly during times of conflict and instability. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), we are developing a tool that can effectively identify and mitigate bias in real-time.

## Motivation:

The proliferation of biased news content can have significant negative consequences, influencing individual and organizational decision-making, exacerbating existing conflicts, and ultimately leading to injustice. We are driven by the desire to create a more informed and equitable world by ensuring that news media provides accurate and unbiased information.

## MVP Development:

An initial minimum viable product (MVP) has been developed using Python, Django, and Google's MakeSuite. This MVP demonstrates the core functionality of the tool, which involves:

Real-time analysis of news content: The tool ingests news articles from various sources and analyzes them for potential bias.
AI-powered bias detection: Utilizing NLP and machine learning algorithms, the tool identifies biased language, framing, and other indicators of bias.
Transparency and explainability: The tool provides users with clear explanations of its findings, allowing them to assess the credibility and neutrality of the analyzed content.

## Future Development:

We are actively working on improving the tool's accuracy, efficiency, and user-friendliness. This includes:

Expanding the scope of the analysis to cover a wider range of bias types and media formats.
Integrating the tool with existing news platforms and aggregators for easier access and wider adoption.
Developing user-friendly dashboards and reports to present the analysis results in a clear and actionable way.
